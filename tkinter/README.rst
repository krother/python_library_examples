How to create a graphical desktop window?
=========================================

Tkinter allows you to create graphical interfaces.
It's a bit oldschool and the class structure appears convoluted in 2025, but some might want to try it anyway. 

`Tk` is installed with Python by default.

Here is an example program with two images:

-  :download:`titanic.py`
-  :download:`titanic.png`
-  :download:`titanic2.png`
