How to parse a HTML page?

The `BeautifulSoup` library parses HTML pages into a tree like data structure.
The data structure corresponds very much to the DOM model.
Beautiful soup is much, much easier to use than the default HTML parser installed with Python.

Install it with:

.. code::
    
    pip install bs4

Here is a usage example:

.. literalinclude:: example_bs4.py
